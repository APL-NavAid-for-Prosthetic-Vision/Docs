# Description

This repo contains a collection of documentation from an internal wiki for how to build and compile the SLAMR01 software and hardware for the navigation aid, using ROS1 and the Jetson AGX Xavier or Jetson AGX Orin computing platform.

All referenced software is included in the accompanying "NavAid_" repos on Github, with exception of RTK and Puma/Capra software, which cannot be distributed due to its development under other projects that do not allow distribution outside JHU/APL. This software performed the path planning component of the code and is based on an RRT*-based implementation. As substitute, an open source implementation of RRT* could be used instead.
